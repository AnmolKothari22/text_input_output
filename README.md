# TEXT INPUT AND TEXT OUTPUT (NO typing in terminal AGAIN!!)
by using this , you can type your input in inputer.txt and then expect a output in outputer.txt for a C++ program

## Usage
  just make sure that all file are in the same folder as the program running

## How to use it
  1) type input in inputer.txt , with a blank line inbetween testcases for the selective testcases to run otherwise whole testcases will run always 
  2) type ./executer.sh <filename>.cpp <arguments> in terminal , where <arguments> is a 1 based numbering of the testcases you want to run. eg ./executer.sh file1.cpp 2 4 , in this only 2nd and 4th testcases will learn
  3) expect the output in output.txt , in increasing order of testcases , so both 2 3 6 and 6 2 3 are same. (NOTE: if you give out of bounds testcase number , then it just wont consider those testcases)
